Create a functional program to compute BMI.  Some needed steps: Input Height and Weight. Convert Height from Inches to Centimeters and weight from Pounds to Kilograms.  Output a comment about the input based on the values.

Make this run!

Then Expand to Compute Body Mass Index (BMI) 

BMI = Mass in KG / (Height in Meters)^2  (^2 means Squared)

Convert the BMI value to respond to Over, Under and "Healthy" conditions.  You will have to use google to research what BMI values separate those ranges.

(Note:  I really hate BMI and don't think it is a good indicator of health!)

Here is an outline:

- Prompt for Height
- Input height
- Prompt for Weight
- Input weight
- Convert both to metric (2.540cm is 1 Inch, 100.0cm is 1.0 Meter, 1.0 Kilogram is 2.20462 Pounds) Hint: Uses these constants as provided...no precomputed values!
- Output those values
- Include at least one conditional to produce a comment (snarky or otherwise) about the input value.
- Convert to BMI, Output those results with some assessment and snarky comment.

Hint: Use the FULL constants as-is
